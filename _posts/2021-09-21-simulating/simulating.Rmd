## Agenda <i class="fas fa-calendar-alt" target="_blank"></i>

### September 21, 2021

1. Why simulate?
2. What makes a good simulation?
3. Examples



### September 23, 2021

1. Bias in modeling
2. Simulating statistical inference

## Readings <i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> 

* Class notes: <a href = "http://st47s.com/Math154/Notes/sims.html" target= "_blank">Simulating</a>

* Baumer, Horton, and Kaplan (2021), <a href = "https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html" target = "_blank">Iteration (Chp 7)</a> in Modern Data Science for R.


## Reflection questions <i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i>

* What are some reasons to simulate?
* What makes a good simulation?
* What does "90%" mean when describing a 90% confidence interval?   (That is, 90% of what?)
* What does a type I error rate mean when doing hypothesis testing?  (That is, rate of what?)
* The p-value is the probability of obtaining the observed data or more extreme if the null hypothesis is true.  If probability is interpreted in the long-run-frequency definition, what is happening repeatedly  so as to conceptualize the probability of something happening?

## Ethics considerations <i class="fas fa-balance-scale"></i> 

* How can we use simulations to understand algorithmic bias or other types of problems in modeling?

* What does it mean for two different populations to have different feature distributions?

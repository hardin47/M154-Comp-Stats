## Agenda <i class="fas fa-calendar-alt" target="_blank"></i>

### October 21, 2021

1. What needs to be done to the data?
2. `tidymodels` syntax for recipes
3. Example


## Readings <i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> 


* Class notes: <a href = "http://st47s.com/Math154/Notes/class.html#model-building-process" target= "_blank">k nearest neighbors</a>


* Max Kuhn and Julia Silge (2021), <a href = "https://www.tmwr.org/" target = "_blank">Tidy Modeling with R</a>

## Reflection questions <i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i>

* What is the process for building a model using **tidymodels**?

* Why is it important to do feature engineering for variables in a model?

* How is data separated in order to work with independent information (hint: two ways)?

## Ethics considerations <i class="fas fa-balance-scale"></i> 

* There are two ways that laws are enforced (both equally important):

   1. disparate treatment $\rightarrow$ means that the differential treatment is intentional

   2. disparate impact $\rightarrow$ means that the differential treatment is unintentional or implicit (some examples include advancing mortgage credit, employment selection, predictive policing)

* Anti-discrimination Laws 

    * Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1991
    * Americans with Disabilities Act
    * Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act
    * Equal Credit Opportunity Act
    * Fair Housing Act 


* Questions to ask yourself in every single data analysis you perform (taken from <a href = "https://dssg.uchicago.edu/" target = "_blank">Data Science for Social Good</a> at the University of Chicago):

  * What biases may exist in the data you've been given?  How can you find out?
  * How will your choices with tuning parameters affect different populations represented in the data?
  * How do you know you aren't getting the right answer to the    wrong question?
  * How would you justify what you'd built to someone whose welfare is made worse off by the implementation of your algorithm?
  * See the slides on bias in modeling (9/23/21) for times when there are no inherent biases but the structure of the data create unequal model results.

## Slides <i class="fas fa-desktop"></i> 


* <a href = "https://m154-comp-stats.netlify.app/slides/2021-10-21-recipes" target = "_blank">In class slides</a> for 10/21/21.

## Additional Resources <i class="fas fa-laptop"></i>

* <a href = "https://www.ajlunited.org/" target = "_blank">Algorithmic Justice League</a> is a collective that aims to:

   * Highlight algorithmic bias through media, art, and science

   * Provide space for people to voice concerns and experiences with coded bias

   * Develop practices for accountability during design, development, and deployment of coded systems

### September 14, 2021

1. Tidy data
2. Data verbs



### September 16, 2021

2. `pivot`ing
3. `map`ping
4. **lubridate**

## Readings <i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> 

* Class notes: <a href = "http://st47s.com/Math154/Notes/wrang.html" target= "_blank">Data Wrangling</a>

* Wickham (2017) <a href = "https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html" target = "_blank">Data transformation</a> and <a href = "https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html" target = "_blank">Tidy data</a> in R for Data Science.

## Reflection questions <i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i>

* How and why is `%>%` used?  And how is it different from the layering symbol `+` we use in `ggplot()`?

* What are the main data wrangling verbs?

* How do you distinguish the different `_join` functions?  Are the `_join` keys formatted in the same way across the two datasets?  Are the data recorded in the same way (e.g., is age birthday or age at recording?) ?

* What are some of the ways to distinguish a data verb from a typical function?



## Ethics considerations <i class="fas fa-balance-scale"></i> 

* What is Jan 31 plus one month?  And why does it matter that **every** analysis we do is a series of decisions?  Keeping in mind that each of us might make a different decision, and all decisions have consequences.

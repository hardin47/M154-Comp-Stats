## Reflection questions <i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i>

* What do I love most about the methods we've been covering?  The math? The statistics? The programming? The algorithms?  The data?  The ethical quandaries?

* The whale shark above is a graphic meant to help understand principal components.  Yet one more thing we didn't touch on, but could have.

## Ethics considerations <i class="fas fa-balance-scale"></i> 

* Keeping asking yourself:

  - How do I stay accountable for my work?
  - How might others be impacted by what I've created?
  - Where did the data come from, and what biases might be inherent?
  - What population is appropriate for any of the inferential claims I'm making?
  - How might individual's privacy or anonymity be impacted by what I've created?
  - Is it possible that my work could be misinterpreted or misused?

title: "10. Random Forests"
description: |
  Many trees make a forest.  Bagging gives FREE independent model assessment or parameter tuning.  Random Forests have a fantastic variance - bias tradeoff.

## Reflection questions <i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i>

* How does bagging improve on a single tree?  How does tuning `mtry` improve on a single tree?

* How do Random Forests make predictions on test data?

* Can Random Forests be used for both classification and regression or only one of the two tasks?

* Can you use categorical / character predictors with Random Forests?

* How are `mtry` and the number of trees chosen?

* How do the bias and variance change for different values of `mtry` and number of trees?

* What are the advantages of the Random Forests algorithm?

* What are the disadvantages of the Random Forest algorithm?

## Ethics considerations <i class="fas fa-balance-scale"></i> 

* What type of feature engineering is required for Random Forests?

* Do Random Forests produce a closed form "model" that can be written down or visualized and handed to a client?

* If the model produces near perfect predictions on the test data, what are some potential concerns about putting that model into production?

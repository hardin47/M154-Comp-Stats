title: "9. k-NN + trees"
description: |
  k-Nearest Neighbors is a classification algorithm based on the premise that points which are close to one another (in some predictor space) are likely to be similar with respect to the outcome variable.  trees represent a set of methods where prediction is based on majority vote or average outcome based on a partition of the predictor space.

## Reflection questions <i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i>

* What is the "$k$" in $k$-Nearest Neighbors?  What does CART stand for?

* Why do most implementations of $k$-NN prefer odd values of k?

* How does $k$-NN / CART make predictions on test data?

* Can $k$-NN / CART be used for both classification and regression or only one of the two tasks?

* Can you use categorical / character predictors with $k$-NN / CART?

* How is $k$ / tree depth chosen?

* What does it mean for CART to be high variance?  How do the bias and variance change for different values of $k$ in $k$-NN?

* What are the advantages of the $k$-NN / CART algorithm?

* What are the disadvantages of the $k$-NN / CART algorithm?

## Ethics considerations <i class="fas fa-balance-scale"></i> 

* What type of feature engineering is required for $k$-NN / CART?

* Why is it recommended that $k$-NN not be used on large datasets?

* (For a given $k$) why does $k$-NN use more computation time to test than to train?  [n.b., the opposite is true for the majority of classificiation and regression algorithms.]

> With the help of the Rand Corp., the city tried to measure fire response times, identify redundancies in service, and close or re-allocate fire stations accordingly. What resulted, though, was a perfect storm of bad data: The methodology was flawed, the analysis was rife with biases, and the results were interpreted in a way that stacked the deck against poorer neighborhoods. The slower response times allowed smaller fires to rage uncontrolled in the cityâ€™s most vulnerable communities.

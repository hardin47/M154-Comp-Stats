# Agenda  9/7/21

1. Cholera: what went (didn't go) well with the graphics?
2. Challenger: what didn't go (went) well with the graphics?
3. Thoughts on plotting 

Tufte (1997) <a href = "http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_textb" target = "_blank">Visual and Statistical Thinking: Displays of Evidence for Making Decisions</a>.  (Use Google to find it.)

---

# Preliminaries

1. Make the data stand out

2. Facilitate comparison

3. Add information

---

# Preliminaries

Tufte lists two main motivational steps to working with graphics as part of an argument.

1. "An essential analytic task in making decisions based on evidence is to understand how things work."

2. Making decisions based on evidence requires the appropriate display of that evidence."

---

# Cholera - a picture tells 1000 words

```{r fig.cap = "How many aspects of this graph can you point out which are relevant to figuring out that cholera infection was coming from a single pump?  Are there any distracting aspects?", out.width="65%", fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}

```

---

# Cholera - difficult to interpret

```{r fig.cap = "Why would the outbreak already have begun to decline before the pump handle was removed?", out.width="80%", fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images/cholera2.jpg"))
```

---
# Challenger - Problematic

```{r fig.cap = "One of the graphics which was particularly unconvincing in trying to explain that O-rings fail in the cold.", out.width = "70%", fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}

```

---
# Challenger - Improved

```{r fig.cap = "The graphic the engineers should have led with in trying to persuade the administrators not to launch.  It is evident that the number of O-ring failures is quite highly associated with the ambient temperature.  Note the *vital* information on the x-axis associated with the large number of launches at warm temperatures that had *zero* O-ring failures.", fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}

---

# Advice on plotting, specific

- Avoid having other graph elements interfere with data
- Use visually prominent symbols
- Avoid over-plotting  (One way to avoid over plotting: Jitter the values)
- Different values of data may obscure each other
- Include all or nearly all of the data
- Fill data region

--- 

# Advice on plotting, general

* Eliminate superfluous material
* Facilitate comparisons
* Choose the best scale
* Make the plot data / information rich
* Use good captions, alt text, conclusions


---

# Simplify

```{r, out.width = "85%", fig.cap = "image credit: https://www.darkhorseanalytics.com/portfolio-data-looks-better-naked", fig.alt = "A gif of a barplot which starts out cluttered with labels and slowly becomes simplified with the relevant information highlighted.", echo=FALSE}

# Agenda  9/9/21

1. Grammar of graphics
2. `ggplot2`


---

# Goals

What I will try to do

 * give a tour of `ggplot2`
 
 * explain how to think about plots the `ggplot2` way
 
 * prepare/encourage you to learn more later
 
What I can't do in one session

 * show every bell and whistle
 
 * make you an expert at using `ggplot2`
 

---

# HELP

1.  One of the best ways to get started with ggplot is to google what you want to do with the word ggplot.  Then look through the images that come up.  More often than not, the associated code is there.  There are also ggplot galleries of images, one of them is here: https://plot.ly/ggplot2/

2. Look at the end of this presentation.  More help options there.

## Pieces of the Graph

Yau (2013) gives us nine visual cues, and Wickham (2014) translates them into a language using `ggplot2`.  

1. Visual Cues:  the aspects of the figure where we should focus.  
**Position** (numerical) where in relation to other things?  
**Length** (numerical) how big (in one dimension)?  
**Angle** (numerical) how wide? parallel to something else?  
**Direction** (numerical) at what slope?  In a time series, going up or down?  
**Shape** (categorical) belonging to what group?  
**Area** (numerical) how big (in two dimensions)?  Beware of improper scaling!  
**Volume** (numerical) how big (in three dimensions)?  Beware of improper scaling!  
**Shade** (either) to what extent?  how severely?  
**Color** (either) to what extent? how severely? Beware of red/green color blindness.  

2. Coordinate System: rectangular, polar, geographic, etc.

3. Scale: numeric (linear? logarithmic?), categorical (ordered?), time

4. Context: in comparison to what (think back to ideas from Tufte)

## The grammar of graphics `ggplot` 
            

**geom**: the geometric "shape" used to display data
 
  * bar, point, line, ribbon, text, etc.
 
**aesthetic**: an attribute controlling how geom is displayed wih respect to variables

  * x position, y position, color, fill, shape, size, etc.

**scale**: adjust information in the aesthetic to map onto the plot

  * *particular* assignment of colors, shapes, sizes, etc.; making axes continuous or constrained to a particular range of values.
 
**guide**: helps user convert visual data back into raw data (legends, axes)

**stat**: a transformation applied to data before geom gets it

  * example: histograms work on binned data

 *  The layers are placed one on top of the other:  the points 
are *below* and the lines are *above*.   

 * `data` and `aes` specified in `ggplot()` affect all geoms
]

---

## Alternative Syntax
    
.pull-left[
```{r echo=FALSE}
Births78 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=date, y=births, color=wday)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line()+
  ggtitle("US Births in 1978")
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r eval=FALSE}
Births78 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=date, 
             y=births, 
             color=wday)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line()+
  ggtitle("US Births in 1978")
```
]


---

## What does this code do?
  

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Births78 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=date, y=births, color="navy")) + 
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("US Births in 1978") 
```

--

```{r, echo=FALSE}
Births78 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=date, y=births, color="navy")) + 
  geom_point()  +
  ggtitle("US Births in 1978")
```

This is *mapping* the color aesthetic to a new variable with 
only one value ("navy").  
So all the dots get set to the same color, but it's not navy.

---

## Setting vs. Mapping

If we want to *set* the color to be navy for all of the dots, we do 
it this way:

```{r}
Births78 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=date, y=births)) +   # map these 
  geom_point(color = "navy")   +     # set this
  ggtitle("US Births in 1978")
```

* Note that `color = "navy"` is now outside of the aesthetics list.  That's how `ggplot2` distinguishes between mapping and setting.

---

## How do we make this plot?
    
.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
Births78 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=date, y=births)) + 
  geom_line(aes(color=wday)) +        # map color here
  geom_point(color="navy")  +          # set color here
  ggtitle("US Births in 1978")
```
]

---

## How do we make this plot?
    
.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
Births78 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=date, 
             y=births)) + 
  geom_line(aes(color=wday)) +        # map color here
  geom_point(color="navy") +           # set color here
  ggtitle("US Births in 1978")
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, eval=FALSE}
Births78 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=date, 
             y=births)) + 
  geom_line(aes(color=wday)) +       # map color here
  geom_point(color="navy")  +         # set color here
  ggtitle("US Births in 1978")
```

* `ggplot()` establishes the default data and aesthetics
for the geoms, but each geom may change these defaults.

* good practice: put into `ggplot()` the things that affect all (or most) of the layers; rest in `geom_blah()`
]

---

## Setting vs. Mapping (again)

Information gets passed to the plot via:

a. `map` the **variable** information inside the aes (aesthetic) command

a. `set` the **non-variable** information outside the aes (aesthetic) command

```{r, echo=TRUE, comment=NA}

             y=births,

... not a good plot


* overplotting is hiding much of the data

]

---

## Side note: what makes a plot good?
   

Most (all?) graphics are intended to help us make comparisons

* How does something change over time?
* Do my treatments matter?  How much?
* Do treatnent and control respond the same way?

**Key plot metric:** Does my plot make the comparisions 
I am interested in 

* easily, and 
* accurately?

  ggplot(aes(x=age)) + 
  geom_line(stat="density")+
  ggtitle("HELP clinical trial at detoxification unit")
```

---

## Selecting stat and geom manually
    
Every stat comes with a default geom, every geom with a default stat

* we can specify stats instead of geom, if we prefer
* we can mix and match geoms and stats however we like

```{r, fig.height=2.0}
HELPrct %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=age)) + 
  stat_density( geom="line")+
  ggtitle("HELP clinical trial at detoxification unit")
```

---

## More combinations

```{r, fig.height=1.7}
HELPrct %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=age)) + 
  geom_point(stat="bin", binwidth=3) + 
  geom_line(stat="bin", binwidth=3)  +
  ggtitle("HELP clinical trial at detoxification unit")
```

---

## More combinations

```{r, fig.height=1.7}
HELPrct %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=age)) + 
  geom_area(stat="bin", binwidth=3)  +
  ggtitle("HELP clinical trial at detoxification unit")
```

---

## More combinations

```{r fig.height=5}
HELPrct %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=age)) + 
  geom_point(stat="bin", binwidth=3, aes(size=..count..)) +
  geom_line(stat="bin", binwidth=3) +
  ggtitle("HELP clinical trial at detoxification unit")
```

---

## How much drinking? (i1)
    

```{r, fig.height=1.5}
HELPrct %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=i1)) + geom_histogram()+
  ggtitle("HELP clinical trial at detoxification unit")
```

---

## How much drinking? (i1)
 
```{r, fig.height=1.5}
HELPrct %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=i1)) + geom_density()+
  ggtitle("HELP clinical trial at detoxification unit")
```

---

## How much drinking? (i1)
 
```{r, fig.height=1.5}
HELPrct %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=i1)) + geom_area(stat="density")+
  ggtitle("HELP clinical trial at detoxification unit")
```


---

## Covariates: Adding in more variables
   

Using color and linetype:

```{r fig.height = 4}
HELPrct %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=i1, color=substance, linetype=sex)) + 
  geom_line(stat="density")+
  ggtitle("HELP clinical trial at detoxification unit")
```

---

## Using color and facets

```{r, fig.height=1.6}
HELPrct %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=i1, color=substance)) + 
  geom_line(stat="density") + facet_grid( . ~ sex )+
  ggtitle("HELP clinical trial at detoxification unit")
```

```{r, fig.height=1.6}
HELPrct %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=i1, color=substance)) + 
  geom_line(stat="density") + facet_grid( sex ~ . )+
  ggtitle("HELP clinical trial at detoxification unit")
```


---

## Boxplots 
   
Boxplots use `stat_quantile()` (five number summary).

The quantitative variable must be `y`, and there must be an 
additional `x` variable. 

```{r fig.height = 3.5}
HELPrct %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=substance, y=age, color=sex)) + 
  geom_boxplot()+
  ggtitle("HELP clinical trial at detoxification unit")
```

---

## Horizontal boxplots
    
Horizontal boxplots  are obtained by flipping the coordinate system:

* `coord_flip()` may be used with other plots as well to reverse the roles
of `x` and `y` on the plot.

```{r fig.height = 3.5}
HELPrct %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=substance, y=age, color=sex)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  coord_flip()+
  ggtitle("HELP clinical trial at detoxification unit")
```

---

## Axes scaling with boxplots
    
We can scale the continuous axis
```{r fig.height = 3.5, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
HELPrct %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=substance, y=age, color=sex)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  coord_trans(y="exp")+
  ggtitle("HELP clinical trial at detoxification unit")
```


---

## Give me some space
  
We've triggered a new feature: `dodge` (for dodging things left/right).
We can control how much if we set the dodge manually.

```{r fig.height=3.5}
HELPrct %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=substance, y=age, color=sex)) + 
  geom_boxplot(position=position_dodge(width=1)) +
  ggtitle("HELP clinical trial at detoxification unit")
```


---

## Issues with bigger data

* Although we can see a generally positive association (as we would 
expect), the overplotting may be hiding information.

```{r fig.height=3.5}
require(NHANES)
dim(NHANES)
NHANES %>%  ggplot(aes(x=Height, y=Weight)) +
  geom_point() + facet_grid( Gender ~ PregnantNow )
```


---

## Using alpha (opacity)

One way to deal with overplotting is to set the opacity low.

```{r fig.height = 3.5}
NHANES %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Height, y=Weight)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.01) + facet_grid( Gender ~ PregnantNow )
```

---

## geom_density2d
  
Alternatively (or simultaneously) we might prefere a different 
geom altogether.

```{r fig.height = 3.5}
NHANES %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Height, y=Weight)) +
  geom_density2d() + facet_grid( Gender ~ PregnantNow )
```

---

## Multiple layers

```{r fig.height = 3.5}
ggplot( data=HELPrct, aes(x=sex, y=age)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.size=0) +
  geom_jitter(alpha=.6) +
  coord_flip()+
  ggtitle("HELP clinical trial at detoxification unit")
```

---

## Multiple layers

```{r fig.height = 3.5}
ggplot( data=HELPrct, aes(x=sex, y=age)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.size=0) +
  geom_point(alpha=.6, position=position_jitter(width=.1, height=0)) +
  coord_flip()+
  ggtitle("HELP clinical trial at detoxification unit")
```


---

## Things I haven't mentioned (much)
 
 * coords (`coord_flip()` is good to know about)
 
 * themes (for customizing appearance)

 * position (`position_dodge()`, `position_jitterdodge()`,
 `position_stack()`, etc.)
 
 * transforming axes

```{r, fig.width=14}
require(ggthemes)
ggplot(Births78, aes(x=date, y=births)) + geom_point() + 
          theme_wsj()
```

  geom_point(aes(color=sex, fill=sex), position=position_jitterdodge()) +
  ggtitle("HELP clinical trial at detoxification unit")
```


---

## A little bit of everything

```{r, fig.width=14}
ggplot( data=HELPrct, aes(x=substance, y=age, color=sex)) +
  geom_boxplot(coef = 10, position=position_dodge(width=1)) +
  geom_point(aes(fill=sex), alpha=.5, 
             position=position_jitterdodge(dodge.width=1)) + 
  facet_wrap(~homeless)+
  ggtitle("HELP clinical trial at detoxification unit")
```

<!--
## Some short cuts
   

1. `qplot()` provides "quick plots" for `ggplot2`
```{r}
qplot(length, width, data=KidsFeet)
```

2. `mplot(dataframe)` provides an interactive plotting tool for 
both `ggplot2` and `lattice`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mplot(HELPrct)
```

* quickly make several plots from a data frame
* can show the expression so you can learn how to do it or 
copy and paste into another document

`plotly` 

> `Plotly` is an R package for creating interactive web-based graphs via plotly's JavaScript graphing library, `plotly.js`. The `plotly` R libary contains the `ggplotly` function , which will convert `ggplot2` figures into a Plotly object. Furthermore, you have the option of manipulating the Plotly object with the `style` function.

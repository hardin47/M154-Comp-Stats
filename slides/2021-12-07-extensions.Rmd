## Parallel computing

Set up the clusters to bootstrap the mean of the penguin `mass_g` (`Chinstrap` only).

```{r}
data(penguins)

penguin_bs <- penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Chinstrap") 
```

```{r warning=FALSE, error = FALSE}
P <- parallel::detectCores(logical=FALSE)
P
cl <- parallel::makeCluster(P, setup_strategy = "sequential")
clusterEvalQ(cl, library("tidyverse"))
```

---

## Bootstrap in parallel


```{r}
doParallel::registerDoParallel(cl)
bsmean_mass <- foreach(i = 1:100, .combine = 'c') %dopar% {
  penguin_bs %>%
    mutate(mass_bs = sample(body_mass_g, replace = TRUE)) %>%
    summarize(mean(mass_bs)) %>% pull()
}
boot_results <- tibble(bsmean_mass)
stopCluster(cl)
```

```{r}
boot_results
```


---

##  Graphing

```{r}
ggplot(boot_results, aes(x = bsmean_mass)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 25) + 
  ggtitle("Histogram of 100 Bootstrapped Means using foreach")
```

---

## Python in R

The main R package which allows Python use in R is called `reticulate`.

```{r}
library(reticulate)
use_virtualenv("r-reticulate")
reticulate::import("statsmodels")
```

## Python code in an RMarkdown chunk

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Rmd]
````
```{python}`r ''`
import pandas
flights = pandas.read_csv("flights.csv")
flights = flights[flights["dest"] == "ORD"]
flights = flights[['carrier', 'dep_delay', 'arr_delay']]
flights = flights.dropna()
```
````
]
.panel[.panel-name[html]
A view of the Python chunk which is actually run:

```{python}
import pandas
flights = pandas.read_csv("flights.csv")
flights = flights[flights["dest"] == "ORD"]
flights = flights[['carrier', 'dep_delay', 'arr_delay']]
flights = flights.dropna()
```
]]

---

## Computations using `pandas`

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Rmd]
````
```{python}`r ''`
flights = pandas.read_csv("flights.csv")
flights = flights[['carrier', 'dep_delay', 'arr_delay']]
flights.groupby("carrier").mean()
```
````
]

.panel[.panel-name[html]
```{python}
flights = pandas.read_csv("flights.csv")
flights = flights[['carrier', 'dep_delay', 'arr_delay']]
flights.groupby("carrier").mean()
```
]
]

---

## From Python chunk to R chunk

* `py$x` accesses an `x` variable created within Python from R
* `r.x` accesses an `x` variable created within R from Python

### SQL in R

Setting up the SQL connection to an external databse

```{r message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
library(RMySQL)
library(DBI)
con <- dbConnect(
  MySQL(), host = "XXX", user = "XXX", 
  password = "XXX", dbname = "XXX")
```


---

## Running SQL code in R

```{r message = FALSE}
dbGetQuery(con, 
  "SELECT subject_race, AVG(subject_age) AS 'ave age' 
  FROM TNnashville 
  GROUP BY subject_race
  ORDER BY `ave age`")
```


---

## SQL code in a SQL chunk

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Rmd]
````
```{sql, connection = con}`r ''`
SELECT subject_race, AVG(subject_age) AS 'ave age' 
  FROM TNnashville 
  GROUP BY subject_race
  ORDER BY `ave age`
```
````
]

.panel[.panel-name[html]
```{sql, connection = con}
SELECT subject_race, AVG(subject_age) AS 'ave age' 
  FROM TNnashville 
  GROUP BY subject_race
  ORDER BY `ave age`
```
]
.panel[.panel-name[SQL to R]
````
```{sql, connection = con, output.var = "TN_age"}`r ''`
SELECT subject_race, AVG(subject_age) AS 'ave age' 
  FROM TNnashville 
  GROUP BY subject_race
  ORDER BY `ave age`
```
````

```{sql, connection = con, output.var = "TN_age"}
SELECT subject_race, AVG(subject_age) AS 'ave age' 
  FROM TNnashville 
  GROUP BY subject_race
  ORDER BY `ave age`
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[R obj]

(From an R chunk)

```{r}
TN_age
```

## Regular expressions (strings)

> A concise mechanism for describing patterns in character strings


* regular expressions
* `stringr`

## Weather Data

```{r fig.cap = "", fig.alt = "Screenshot of weather data across the world on Dec 7, 2021.", out.width='90%', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/weather.png")
```

[https://www.timeanddate.com/weather/](https://www.timeanddate.com/weather/)

---

## Weather Data


```{r}
library(rvest)
weather <- read_html("https://www.timeanddate.com/weather/")
w <- html_table(html_nodes(weather, "table"))[[1]]
```

(tiny bit of wrangling of columns here)

```{r echo = FALSE}
w1 <- w[,c(1,2,4)]
w2 <- w[,c(5,6,8)]
w3 <- w[,c(9,10,12)]
w <- rbind(w1, w2, w3)
names(w) <- c("city", "time", "temp")
w <- w %>% filter(city !="")
```

```{r}
w
```


---

## Matching patterns


```{r}
w %>% filter(str_detect(city, "La"))
```

---

## Matching patterns

To indicate that the pattern must appear at the start of a character string use `^`.

```{r}
w %>% filter(str_detect(city, "^La"))
```

... or the end of a character string use `$`.

```{r}
w %>% filter(str_detect(city, "La$"))
```


---

## Matching patterns

If case doesn't matter use `(?i)`.

```{r}
w %>% filter(str_detect(city, "(?i)La"))
```


---

## Matching patterns

Match for Wednesday (only a few places are Wednesday right now at Tuesday, 6:45am PT).

```{r}
w %>% filter(str_detect(time, "Wed"))
```

---

## Matching patterns

Or not Wednesday

```{r}
w %>% filter(str_detect(time, "Wed", negate = TRUE))
```

---

## Matching patterns


```{r}
w %>%
  mutate(temp_num = str_sub(temp, 1, nchar(temp) -1)) %>% head(3)
```


```{r}
w %>%
  mutate(temp_num = str_sub(temp, 1, nchar(temp) -2)) %>% head(3)
```


---

## Matching patterns

```{r}
w %>%
  mutate(temp_num = str_sub(temp, 1, nchar(temp) -3)) %>% head(3)
```


```{r}
w %>%
  mutate(temp_num = as.numeric(str_sub(temp, 1, nchar(temp) -3))) 
```

---

## Matching patterns

Or by looking for the number in the string.

```{r}
w %>%
  mutate(temp_num = str_extract(temp, "^-?\\d+")) 
```

---

## Matching patterns

How to fix the name which has a `*`?

```{r}
w %>%
  mutate(new_city = str_replace(city, " \\*", ""))
```

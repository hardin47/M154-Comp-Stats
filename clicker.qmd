1. The reason to take random samples is:[^1]
   (a) to make cause and effect conclusions 
   (b) to get as many variables as possible
   (c) it's easier to collect a large dataset
   (d) so that the data are a good representation of the population
   (e) I have no idea why one would take a random sample

[^1]: d. so that the data are a good representation of the population

---

2. The reason to allocate/assign explanatory variables is:[^2]
   (a) to make cause and effect conclusions 
   (b) to get as many variables as possible
   (c) it's easier to collect a large dataset
   (d) so that the data are a good representation of the population
   (e) I have no idea what you mean by "allocate/assign" (or "explanatory variable" for that matter)

[^2]: a. to make cause and effect conclusions

3. Approximately how big is a tweet?[^3]
   (a) 0.01Kb
   (b) 0.1Kb
   (c) 1Kb
   (d) 100Kb
   (e) 1000Kb = 1Mb

[^3]: b. about 0.1Kb.  Turns out that 3.5 billion tweets * 0.1Kb = 350Gb (0.35 Tb).  My laptop is pretty good, and it has 36 Gb of memory (RAM) and 4 Tb of storage.  It would not be able to work with 3.5 billion tweets.

---

4. $R^2$ measures:[^4]
   (a) the proportion of variability in vote margin as explained by tweet share.

   (c) how appropriate the linear part of the linear model is.
   (d) whether or not particular variables should be included in the model.

[^4]: a. the proportion of variability in vote margin as explained by tweet share.

     (c) To provide as much information as possible.

[^15]: Yes! All the responses are reasons to make a figure.

---

16. A good reason to make a particular choice of a graph is:[^16]
     (a) Because the journal / field has particular expectations for how the data are presented.
     (b) Because some variables naturally fit better on some graphs (e.g., numbers on scatter plots).
     (c) Because that graphic displays the message you want as optimally as possible.

[^16]: c. Because that graphic displays the message you want as optimally as possible.

17. Why are the points orange?[^17]
     (a) R translates "navy" into orange.
     (b) color must be specified in `geom_point()`
     (c) color must be specified **outside** the `aes()` function

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="35%"}
```{r}
#| echo: false
library(mosaic)
data(Births78)
ggplot(data = Births78, 
       aes(x = date, y = births, color = "navy")) + 
  geom_point() +          
  ggtitle("US Births in 1978")
```
:::

::: {.column width="65%"}
```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
ggplot(data = Births78, 
       aes(x = date, y = births, color = "navy")) + 
  geom_point() +          
  ggtitle("US Births in 1978")
```
:::

::::

[^17]: c. color must be specified **outside** the `aes()` function

---

18. Why are the dots blue and the lines colored?[^18]
     (a) dot color is given as "navy", line color is given as `wday`.
     (b) both colors are specified in the `ggplot()` function.
     (c) dot coloring takes precedence over line coloring.
     (d) line coloring takes precedence over dot coloring.
     
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: 60%
library(mosaic)
data(Births78)
ggplot(data = Births78, 
       aes(x = date, y = births)) + 
  geom_line(aes(color = wday)) +       
  geom_point(color = "navy") +          
  ggtitle("US Births in 1978")
```
     
[^18]: a. dot color is specified as "navy", line color is specified as `wday`.

20. The Snow figure was most successful at:[^20]
     (a) making the data stand out
     (b) facilitating comparison
     (c) putting the work in context
     (d) simplifying the story

[^20]: answers may vary. I'd say c. putting the work in context.  Others might say b. facilitating comparison or d. simplifying the story.  However, I don't think a correct answer is a. making the data stand out.

---

21. The Challenger figure(s) was(were) least successful at:[^21]
    (a) making the data stand out
    (b) facilitating comparison
    (c) putting the work in context
    (d) simplifying the story

[^21]: a. making the data stand out

---

22. The biggest difference between Snow and the Challenger was:[^22]

     (a) It isn’t at the origin.
     (b) They should have used all the data possible to find averages.

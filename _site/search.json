Here is the basic structure of how it will work:\nGet the assignment materials from GitHub classroom.\nClone the repository to any machine you are using.\nWork on the assignment and push back to GitHub.\nSubmit the assignment on Gradescope.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: image credit: xkcd\n\n\n\nThe following diagram lays out the process, and the rest of the\ndocument provides a more detailed set of instructions.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Flowchart of assignment process.\n\n\n\nInstalling R + RStudio + Git\nMost importantly, please become familiar with Happy Git and GitHub with R. Happy\nGit with R is an incredibly user friendly resource which includes help\nfor almost every single thing that might happen when getting\nstarted.\nHappy Git with R is your new\nbest friend.\nThe first step is to install R + RStudio + Git on your machine.\n(If you are planning to use Pomona’s RStudio server, R + RStudio + Git\nare all three already installed for you.)\nCreate an account on GitHub (if you already have one, use\nit!).\nIntroduce everyone: R + RStudio (should happen automatically);\nyourself to GitHub (see https://happygitwithr.com/); RStudio + GitHub (see https://happygitwithr.com/).\nFollow the rest of the steps that Jenny Bryan spells out in Happy Git and GitHub with R. Most\nlikely, you only need to work through step 12. Step 15 is detailed below\nafter you have gotten the assignment from GitHub.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: The more you read Happy Git with R, the better\nyour life will be.\n\n\n\nGet the\nassignment materials from GitHub Classroom\nEach assignment will be provided as a link to GitHub classroom. Click\nthe link. (The link will come to you via an email from Sakai. If you\nlose the email, or the email goes to your spam folder, check Sakai\nmessages for the assignment link.)\n\nWhen you use GitHub classroom for the first time, you’ll be asked to\nauthorize GitHub classroom to access your repositories.\nThe first assignment will be an individual assignment. Some other\nassignments will be paired or group assignments. To accept an individual\nassignment, click the “Accept this assignment” button.\nFor all joint assignments, you will need to create a\nteam before you can start.\nIf you are working with a partner, create a team name that contains\nboth of your GitHub ids. (If you are working by yourself, use your\nGitHub id as your team name.)\nOne partner accepts the assignment and creates the team.\nIf you are working with a partner, the person who did not\ncreate the team and accept the assignment should now click the GitHub\nclassroom link, find the newly created team, and click the Join\nbutton.\n\n⚠ You may need to add a description of the assignment (for example “Lab\n2”) to team name. This is because GitHub Classroom does seem to make it\neasy for some people to work in the same group as a previous assignment\nwhile other people form new groups.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Accept the assignment to create a different\nrepository for every assignment.\n\n\n\nThe assignment files will be copied as a private repository that you\n(and your partner, if applicable) and the course staff have access\nto.\nWe will call this version, that lives on your personal GitHub account\nthe GitHub fork.\nClone\nthe assignment (or project) repository on to your own computer(s)\nOnce your repository has been created, you should clone the code to\nwhatever computer you are working on. Just like a Google Doc, you can\nwork on the files from different machines at different times. Unlike a\nGoogle Doc, you’ll have to make sure to open the repo\n(clone or pull if you’ve aleady\ncloned) and save the repo (commit +\npush) more deliberately.\nHappy Git with R is your new\nbest friend.\nClick on the link for the repository.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Clink on the link to your assignment repository to\nget started.\n\n\n\nClick the Clone or download button and copy the\nURL.\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Copy the HTTPS URL, and use it to create a new\nproject in RStudio.\n\n\n\nOn the cloning machine (e.g., your own compute or the RStudio\nserver), create a new R project with the URL copied from above. Follow\nthe steps at https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first.html (section\n15.2 New RStudio Project via git clone).\nWork on the\nassignment, push back to GitHub\n\n⚠ Always start your work session with a pull to the computer you are\nworking on, and end your session with a push back to GitHub.\nAll of the GitHub interaction will take place through the RStudio\nIDE. The two important steps for getting the assignment back to GitHub\nare:\npull\nIf you are working with a colleague or on different machines it is so\nincredibly important to get in the habit of immediately clicking on\npull when you start your work. (If you are working alone on\na single machine pull won’t hurt! You’ll just be told that\nyour files are already up to date.)\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Always pull before you start.\npull-work-save-commit-push\n\n\n\nknit your work\nDon’t forget to put your name on the assignment. Also, make sure that\nyou knit to pdf. Knit early and often. The more often you knit, the\nfewer headaches you will have.\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Always pull before you start.\npull-work-knit-commit-push\n\n\n\ncommit your work\nYou don’t need to commit every file, but you do need to commit files\nthat are integral to the analysis (always commite .Rmd, .pdf, data\nfiles, images that created the pdf, etc.).\n\n\n\nFigure 9: pull-work-knit-commit-push\n\n\n\npush your work to\nGitHub\nIt is good practice to use meaningful commit messages to help your\nfuture self figure out your past work.\n\n\n\nFigure 10: pull-work-knit-commit-push\n\n\n\ncheck your work on GitHub\nTo make sure that the work went through, always check your GitHub\nrepo online to confirm any changes you made.\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Check that your changes are correct.\n\n\n\nSubmit the assignment on\nGradescope\nYou will submit your assignments via Gradescope. To submit your\nassignment, complete the following steps:\n\nThe first time you submit, you may need to click “Connect to GitHub”, to\nconnect your Gradescope account to your GitHub account.\nAccess the course’s Gradescope site, select the appropriate\nassignment, and then choose GitHub as the submission method. You must\naccess the course’s Gradescope site via the side menu in Sakai.\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Access Gradescope via Sakai.\n\n\n\nThe first time you submit your repository, you will need to\nauthorize Gradescope to access your git repository. Select the\nappropriate repository and branch (branch will almost always be\nmain).\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Submit files directly from GitHub.\n\n\n\nIf this is a pair-programming submission, you will need to associate\nall team members with the submission. After you upload your files, click\n“Add Group Member” and add your partner to the submission. Add your team\nmember to your Gradescope submission\nYou can submit multiple times before the deadline. Your last\nsubmission will determine your grade.\nOnce assignments are completely graded, you will be able to see your\ngrade and assignment feedback on Gradescope. Grades will also be synched\nwith Sakai.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Artwork by @allison_horst.\n\n\n\nProject Instructions\nYou will undertake a computational statistics project on a topic of\nyour choice focused on a dataset. The project is an\nopportunity to show off what you’ve learned about the entire process of\nrunning a computational statistics analysis. It is a major component of\nthe class, and successful completion is required to pass. Your final\noutput for this project will be:\na technical report written in R Markdown, compiled to pdf\nan oral presentation delivered to the class\nGroup Formation\nYou will work in a group of (approximately) three students. You may\nchoose your own groups, or I would be happy to assign you to a group.\nThe best groups will have team members with similar interests as far as\napplication areas (e.g., biology, economics, etc.) but differing\nabilities and interests in terms of computational statistics (e.g., a\nstronger programmer combined with a visualization designer combined with\na domain knowledge expert). See\nGroup\nRoles for more information on allocating tasks.\nAssignment\nYour task is to use data to tell us something interesting. This\nproject is deliberately open-ended to allow you to fully explore your\ncreativity. There are three main rules that must be followed:\nYour project must be centered around data. Preferably, you will\nwork with large, complex, and/or messy data. The more challenging your\ndata set is, the better. Two things that will make your project more\nambitious (and more interesting) are:\nCombining two or more data sets that are not obviously related. For\nexample, in the tweets predicting elections paper from the first day of\nclass, the researchers had to combine data from Twitter that had nothing\nto do with politics with a data set of congressional districts, and both\ndata sets had to be spatially-aware, since the merging was done\naccording to the geographical location of the tweet.\nAccessing a live data stream. There are many APIs on the Internet\nthat allow you to access data that changes on a continual basis. This is\nin contrast to static data that was collected at some point in time and\ndoes not change. If your project can respond dynamically to a live data\nstream, then this will make it more interesting.\nPlease note that neither of the above stipulations are requirements –\nthey are merely examples of two considerations that may make your data\nmore challenging to work with – and thus your project more\nambitious.\n\nYour project must tell us something. We’ve seen a range of\nprojects / analyses over the course of the semester. On one extreme are\nvisualization projects (like Snow’s cholera map) that involve virtually\nno statistical analysis. On the other extreme are data mining projects\nlike the KDD cup or Kaggle competitions, which involve very little\nvisualization. Your project can be anywhere on this spectrum, but\nexpectations may be different depending on where you are on the scale.\nAn example of a project that doesn’t tell us anything, would be\nsomething that downloads a single data source and summarizes it, with\nsome perfunctory visualization. Make sure that your project is\nthought-provoking and has some underlying meaning!\nTo get an A, you must show something beyond what we’ve done in\nclass. Some examples: Use a new data mining technique (e.g., an\nartificial neural network, näive Bayes classifier) Use a new programming\ntechnology (e.g., Python, MapReduce, shell scripting… should be new to\nyou!)\nUse a new visualization technology (e.g., Inkscape, Illustrator,\nShiny, Processing)\nUse a new live data source or API (e.g., Flickr, Facebook,\nCoinMarketCap)\n[Note: just downloading a new data set in a flat file does not\ncount!]\nUse a new data format (e.g., XML, HDF5, JSON)\nCompare two datasets (e.g.,\nLa\nQuinta vs. Dennys!)\nAlso, domain knowledge does not count here, so your outside knowledge of\nprotein folding makes for a great motivation, but it doesn’t count as\nsomething extra.\n\nAt some point in the project, you should give an\nanalysis/discussion of where the data came from and what/who it\nrepresents.\nLast, you must address any ethical considerations that came about\nduring the project. How were you or weren’t you able to address the\nethical issues that came up?\nIn addition to the examples you have seen over the course of the\nsemester (and previous project links given at the bottom of this page),\nhere are some generic ideas:\nCompete (strongly) in a past KDD cup or Kaggle competition\nCreate a GoogleMaps mash-up\nWrite an R package that provides an API to an online\ndata set\nCreate a Shiny application that helps a Pomona professor analyze\ntheir data\n\nGeneral Rules\nYou may discuss your project with other students, but each group will\nhave a different topic, so there is a limit to how much you can help\neach other. You may consult other sources, and you should credit\nall sources in your report. Feel free to consult with me or\nyour mentors.\nComponents\nProposals\nYour initial proposal (via email to me) is due by midnight on\nTuesday, October 26th. The final proposal (via GitHub project site) will\nbe due the following week on November 2nd.\nPrior to writing your initial proposal you should get together with\nyour group-mates and brainstorm a half dozen or so ideas before\ncoalescing around one idea. Be ambitious! Once you decide on a topic\nthat interests you, think about what you would like to end up with as a\nfinal result – without worrying about how to get there. Try to visualize\nwhat your end product will look like. Will it be an interactive map? A\npredictive model? A mobile application? Don’t think about coding, or a\nparticular data set, or what you know how to do now. If you come up with\nsomething ambitious and original, you’ll be more motivated to learn new\nthings as you go in order to accomplish your goal.\nThe topic is completely open to your choice, but keep in mind the\nthree main rules listed above. Try to think about how you will satisfy\nthe criteria.\nContent\nYour initial (via email) and revised (via GitHub) proposals should\ncontain the following content:\nGroup Members: List the members of your group. For the revised\nproposal, add additional information about each person’s role. Each\nmember of the group should have two jobs: (1) a group dynamic role, (2)\na project role. See\nGroup\nRoles for more information on allocating tasks.\nTitle: The title of your project\nPurpose: Describe the general topic/phenomenon you want to\nexplore, as well some carefully considered questions that you hope to\naddress. You should make an argument motivating your work. Why should\nsomeone be interested in what you are doing? What do you hope people\nwill learn from your project?\nData: As best you can, describe where you will find your data,\nand what kind of data it is. Will you be working with spatial data in\nshapefiles? Do the data come from json files? Will you be accessing an\nAPI to a live data source? Be as specific as you can, listing URLs and\nfile formats if possible.\nVariables: As much as possible, list, and briefly describe, each\nvariable that you plan to incorporate. If you can, be specific about\nunits, scale, etc.\nEnd Product: Describe what you hope to deliver as a final\nproduct. Will it be a Shiny application that will be posted on the\nInternet? Will it be a GoogleMaps mash-up? Will it be a package that\nprovides an API to a live data source (e.g., twitteR)? Will it be a\nmethod that draws some statistical conclusions? Will it be a predictive\nmodel that forecasts future values of some quantity?\nUpdate\nPlease respond to the following three questions (posted to your\nGitHub repo) by the end of the day Friday, November 19th.\nHave you already collected, or do you have access to, all of the\ndata that you will need in order to complete your project? If not,\nplease estimate the percentage of the data that you have, describe any\nissues that you are having, and what your plan is for getting the rest\nof the data.\nWhat is the single biggest unresolved issue you are having?\nPlease describe it briefly, and what your plan is for resolving this\nissue.\nWhat are the elements from outside of the course, if any, that\nyou plan to incorporate into your project?\nPresentation\nAn effective oral presentation is an integral part of this project.\nOne of the objectives of this class is to give you experience conveying\nthe results of a technical investigation to a non-technical audience in\na way that they can understand. Whether you choose to stay in academia\nor pursue a career in industry, the ability to communicate clearly is of\nparamount importance. As a statistician (data scientist, software\nengineer, etc.), the burden of proof is on you to convince your audience\nthat what you are saying is true. If your audience (who may very well be\nless knowledgeable about statistics than you are) cannot understand your\nresults or their interpretations, then the technical merit of your\nproject is irrelevant.\nOn Friday/Tuesday, December 10/14th, your group will make a 10-12\nminute oral presentation to the class. You should make (good) slides.\nYour goal should be to convey to your audience a clear understanding of\nyour research topic, along with a basic understanding of your project,\nand how well it addresses the research question you posed. You should\nnot tell us everything that you did, or show a bunch of\nthings that you tried that didn’t work well. After hearing your talk,\neach student in the class should be able to answer:\nWhat was your project about?\nWhat format was the original data in, and what [downloading, data\nwrangling, data analysis] techniques did you apply to it?\nWhat were your findings?\nYou should prepare electronic slides for your talk. PowerPoint is\nfine, but you might also want to consider Markdown slides\n(ioslides,\nSlidy,\nor\nreveal.js),\nGoogle Presentation, Beamer (LaTeX), or alternative, non-linear\npresentation software like\nPrezi. Use your\ncreativity! One thing you should not do is walk us through your\ncalculations in R Studio. If your project has any interactive elements,\nplease demonstrate them for us!\nYou will need to email me and submit your slides to GitHub before\nyour presentation, and as a back-up ideally the presentation will also\nlive in the cloud somewhere. You should plan to not\nhook up your laptop to the computer in Millikan 1021 (unless you have\ngood reason and have spoken to me about it beforehand).\nAdvice\nThere are many sources of advice for how to make a good presentation,\nbut an excellent place to start is a project called\nTechnically\nSpeaking.\nWatch the videos on this site to identify some common mistakes. Here\nis some general advice:\nBudget your time. You only have ~10 minutes, and we will be running\na tight schedule. Plan for 8-10 minutes to talk, and 2 minutes to answer\nquestions. If your talk runs too short or too long, it makes you seem\nunprepared. Rehearse your talk ahead of time (with your group) several\ntimes in order to get a better feel for your timing. Note also that you\nmay have a tendency to talk faster during your actual talk than you will\nduring your rehearsal. Talking faster in order to speed up is not a good\nstrategy – you are much better off simply cutting material ahead of\ntime.\nDon’t write too much on each slide. You don’t want people to have to\nread your slides, because if the audience is reading your slides, then\nthey aren’t listening to you. You want your slides to provide visual\ncues to the points that you are making – not substitute for your spoken\nwords. Concentrate on graphical displays and bullet-pointed lists of\nideas (not sentences).\nPut your problem in context. Remember that most of your audience\nwill have little or no knowledge of your subject matter. The easiest way\nto lose people is to dive right into technical details that require\nprior domain knowledge. Spend a few minutes at the beginning of your\ntalk introducing your audience to the most basic aspects of your topic\nand present some motivation for what you are studying.\nSpeak loudly and clearly. Remember that you know more about your\ntopic that anyone else in the room, so speak and act with\nconfidence!\nTell a story – not necessarily the whole story. It is unrealistic to\nexpect that you can tell your audience everything that you know about\nyour topic in 10 minutes. You should strive to convey the big ideas in a\nclear fashion, but not dwell on the details. Your talk will be\nsuccessful if your audience is able to walk away with an understanding\nof what your research question was, how you addressed it, and what the\nimplications of your findings are.\nWrite-Up\nYour write-up will similar to a report to client crafted in R\nMarkdown, compiled to a pdf, due on Tuesday, December 14th by\nmidnight.\nIn your write-up, you should tell a data science audience about your\nproject, why they should care about it, and what you have discovered.\nYour audience will be people like you – current or aspiring data\nscientists. Keep in mind that this audience is extraordinarily diverse\nin terms of skills and abilities, so you should assume very little about\nwhat they might know. However, your audience is reasonably tech-savvy,\nso you need not “dumb-down” your analysis.\nNote that ideally, you would be able to use the write-up to show a\nfuture employer or graduate school an example of something interesting\nwhich you have produced.\nContent\nYou do not need to present all of the R code that you wrote\nthroughout the process of working on this project. However, the write-up\nshould contain the minimal set of R code that is necessary to understand\nyour results and findings. If you make a claim, it must be justified by\nexplicit calculation. A knowledgeable reviewer should be able to compile\nyour .Rmd file without modification (caveat: unless you also did work\noutside of R), and verify every statement that you have made. All of the\nR code necessary to produce your figures and tables must appear in the\n.Rmd version of the write-up. All of the R code necessary to understand\nyour work should appear in the .pdf version of the write-up.\nAny data you use should either be obtained dynamically (e.g., from a\nwebsite) or saved into your project repository (unless the dataset is\ntoo big, and we’ve already discussed that the data are hosted\nlocally).\nMotivation\nBe sure to motivate your topic at the beginning of your write-up. You\nshould try to hook the reader early on. Assume that your audience is a\nskeptical data scientist who has stumbled across your write-up but has\nvery little time to read it. Can you give her a reason to continue\nreading? A cool visualization or result can help.\nFormat\nYou don’t need to follow a specific format in the write-up, but you\nshould start with an introductory paragraph and finish with a\nconclusion. The paragraphs needs not follow the formal writing style\nthat you would use in most other classes. Here, a colloquial style that\nis accessible to a lay reader is appropriate.\nNevertheless, your write-up should address the following\nquestions:\nWhy should anyone care about this?\nWhat is the project about? Do not assume that your readers have any\ndomain knowledge! The burden of explanation as to what you are talking\nabout is on you! For example, if your project involves phylogenetic\ntrees, do not assume that your audience has anything other than a basic,\nlay understanding of genetics.\nWhere did your data come from? What kind of data was it? Is there a\nlink to the data or some other way for the reader to follow up on your\nwork? Be sure to cite / reference where your data came from!!\nWhat are your findings? What kind of statistical computations (if\nany) have you done to support those conclusions? Again, while the R code\nwill show how the calculation was performed, it is up to you to\ninterpret, in English sentences, the results of these calculations. Do\nnot forget about units, axis labels, etc.\nWhat are the limitations of your work? Be clear so that others do\nnot misinterpret your findings. To what population do your results\napply? Do they generalize? Could your work be extended with more data or\ncomputational power or time to analyze? How could your study be\nimproved? Suggesting plausible extensions don’t weaken your work – they\nstrengthen it by connecting it to future work.\nWhat ethical considerations that came about during the project. How\nwere you or weren’t you able to address those issues?\nWhat did you learn beyond what we’ve covered in class?\nStyle\nThe notebook (i.e., Rmd + pdf) format is designed to be an\ninteractive document. Take advantage of this by including hyperlinks,\nfigures, videos, etc. to provide context for the reader. It is likely\nthat you will include references section or a\nbibliography,\nand your references should be embedded via links. Use Markdown elements\nlike links, lists, LaTeX, and images as needed.\nVisualizations, particularly interactive ones, will be well-received.\nThat said, do not overuse visualizations. You may be better off with one\ncomplicated but well-crafted visualization as opposed to many\nquick-and-dirty plots. Do not forget Tufte! Any plots should be\nwell-thought out, properly labelled, informative, and visually\nappealing!\nThe R code is there to support the technical reader who wishes to dig\ninto your work – not to substitute for written explanation. Do not\npresent long unbroken chunks of R code without offering written\nexplanations. It is rarely necessary to have more than three or four\nlines of R code in a single chunk. Feel free to echo=FALSE\nany code which is not relevant to the story you are telling.\nCiting Sources\nAs you know, you should cite all references that you use. This\nincludes (among other things) research articles, important information\n(e.g., “7% of NHL players are non-white”), R packages, other (e.g.,\nPython) packages, and relevant algorithms (e.g., NRC Word-Emotion\nAssociation Lexicon). You may use any formatting for the citations as\nlong as the citations are consistent, standard usage, and contain all\nrelevant information for your reader to find the appropriate\ndocumentation.\nThe information you need to cite any R package is given by the R\ncommand citation(). For example:\n\n> citation(\"dplyr\")\n\n\nTo cite package ‘dplyr’ in publications use:\n\n\nHadley Wickham, Romain Francois, Lionel Henry and Kirill Müller\n(2017). dplyr: A Grammar of Data Manipulation. R package version 0.7.4.\nhttps://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dplyr\n\n\nA BibTeX entry for LaTeX users is\n\n\n@Manual{, title =\n{dplyr: A Grammar of Data Manipulation}, author = {Hadley Wickham and\nRomain Francois and Lionel Henry and Kirill Müller}, year = {2017}, note\n= {R package version 0.7.4}, url = {https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dplyr}, }\n\nGroup Dynamic Report\nIdeally, all group members would be equally involved and able and\ncommitted to the project. In reality, it doesn’t always work that way.\nIndividuals should be rewarded fairly for their group efforts; it’s\ninevitable that there will be variation in how high a priority people\nput on this class and how much effort they put into this project.\nTo this end, I would like each of you (individually) to describe how\nwell (or how poorly!) your project group worked together and shared the\nload. This can take the form of an email (not GitHub because of the\npersonal nature), to be submitted by the Tuesday December 14th. Also\ngive some specific comments describing each member’s overall effort.\nWere there certain group members who really put out exceptional effort\nand deserve special recognition? Conversely, were there group members\nwho really weren’t carrying their own weight? And then, at the end of\nyour assessment, estimate the percentage of the total amount of\nwork/effort done by each member. (Be sure your percentages sum to\n100%!)\nFor example, suppose you have 3 group members: X, Y and Z. In the\nevent that each member contributed equally, you could assign:\n33.3% for member X, 33.3% for member Y, and 33.3% for member Z\nOr in case person Z did twice as much work as each other member, you\ncould assign:\n25% for member X, 25% for member Y, and 50% for member Z\nOr if member Y didn’t really do squat, you could assign:\n45% for member X, 10% for member Y, and 45% for member Z\nI will find a fair way to synthesize the (possibly conflicting)\nassessments within each group and fairly incorporate this assessment of\neffort and cooperation in each individual’s overall grade. Don’t\npressure one another to give everyone glowing reports unless it’s\nwarranted, and don’t feel pressured to share your reports with one\nanother. Just be fair to yourselves and to one another. Let me know if\nyou have any questions or if you run into any problems. Also keep in\nmind that GitHub tracks who is committing and who is not committing.\nAssessment Criteria\nYour project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:\nOriginality/Interest: Is the topic original, interesting, and\nsubstantial – or is it trite, pedantic, and trivial? How much\ncreativity, initiative, and ambition did the group demonstrate? Is the\nbasic question driving the project worth investigating, or is it\nobviously answerable without a data-based study?\nDegree of Difficulty: How challenging was the project? Were the data\nparticularly large, complex, and/or messy? Did the data come in an\nobscure format? Was a scraper or API necessary to acquire the data? Was\na challenging visualization or applet constructed? Were any elements\nfrom outside the coursework necessary to complete the project?\nDesign: How well were the graphical elements of the project\ndesigned? Were they clunky or elegant? Was a truly original view of the\ndata presented? Were any interactive elements usable?\nMeaning/Analysis: Did we learn anything meaningful from this\nproject? Are the chosen analyses appropriate for the\nvariables/relationships under investigation, and are the assumptions\nunderlying these analyses met? Are the analyses carried out correctly?\nDid the group make appropriate conclusions from the analyses, and are\nthese conclusions justified?\nWrite-Up: How effectively does the write-up communicate the goals,\nprocedures, and results of the study? Are the claims adequately\nsupported? Does the writing style enhance what the group is trying to\ncommunicate? How well is it edited? Are the statistical claims\njustified? Are text and analyses effectively interwoven? Clear writing,\ncorrect spelling, and good grammar are important.\nOral Presentation: How effectively does the oral presentation\ncommunicate the goals, procedures, and results of the study? Do the\nslides help to illustrate the points being made by the speaker without\ndistracting the audience? Do the presenters seem to be well-rehearsed?\nDid they properly budget their time? Do they appear to be confident in\nwhat they are saying? Are her arguments persuasive?\nPresentation Evaluation\nThe questions below will be used to evaluate the oral\npresentations.\nPeer rubric\nEach of you will evaluate the presentations of your peers keeping the\nfollowing grading rubrics in mind.\nMastery of the material (understanding of the material is strong and\nwell communicated)\nBackground, completeness (thoroughly explains all key points)\nPresentation evaluation (organized, communicates effectively with\nthe audience)\nSome Project Examples / Ideas:\nTopic\nModeling by Benji Lu, Kai Fukutaki, and Ziqi Xiong\nLa\nQuinta vs. Dennys (Colin Rundel & Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel.\nWebinar\nabout the study.

This includes\nscheduling meetings and having a plan for what needs to be done before\nthe next meeting.\nTask Manager: Makes sure that everyone knows what\nthey are expected to do before the next meeting and makes sure that they\ndo it. This might involve calling or emailing each person between\nmeetings to discuss what they have/haven’t done. If someone can’t do the\nwork that needs to be done, the task manager is responsible for calling\nanother meeting if needed.\nFacilitator: Makes sure that every member of the\ngroup is participating and being listened to and heard. This might\ninvolve asking questions of a member that’s been silent and stopping\nothers when someone’s comment is being overlooked.\nProject Roles\nIn each case, the person assuming that role is responsible for that\naspect of the project. It doesn’t mean that they will do all that part\nof the project by themselves; it means that they are responsible for\ndividing that work up among the members of the group and ensuring that\nit is done and recorded correctly.\nDirector of Research: Is responsible for the\nliterature searches. The Director of Research identifies what needs to\nbe searched for in the literature, divvies up the literature searches to\nbe performed among the group members, and coordinates changes in the\nsearches based on information gathered and changes in direction. They\nare also responsible for making sure that the citations in the project\nare complete and accurate.\nDirector of Computation: Is responsible for the\ncomputer programs involved in the project. The Director of Computation\nis responsible for designing the code so that different people can write\ndifferent parts of the code. The programmer is responsible for making\nsure that any code written by different people can be integrated.\nReporter: Is responsible for the written report.\nThis involves taking notes during the complete process in order to keep\na record of what has been done. The reporter may also gather everyone’s\nindividual notes and put them together. The reporter is also responsible\nfor editing the final report and making sure that the various pieces\n(that may have been written by different people) fit well together.\nThings to think about:\nIf all members of a group think that one member isn’t pulling their\nweight then you can come and talk to me about it. I can fire that member\nand have them do the project on their own.\n(Generally) All members of the group get the same grade for the\nproject.\nGrade on projects (a rubric for grading will be posted soon, but\ngenerally the grade will be based on the following):\nGrade for technical depth and sophistication.\nGrade for quality of write-up (organization, clarity, grammatical\ncorrectness, appropriate use of graphs, tables, formulas).\nGrade for quality of oral presentation (organization, clarity,\nappropriate use of graphs, tables formula, ability to answer\nquestions).\nGrade for quality of group work and distribution of labor.\n\nAttendance: you should keep track of who is or isn’t showing up to\ngroup project meetings\nStudents should keep a record of all the times that they worked on\nthe project and the work that they did. Every time that you spend more\nthan 15 minutes on the project they should write down the start and stop\ntime and what they did. Group members should be spending roughly the\nsame amount of time on the project (I will ask you to report on time\nspent on the project so far at the check-in in November.)\nGitHub will track who is committing what to the repository. Ideally,\nyou will all be committing code regularly.\n\n\n\n",

The course will\ngenerally have three parts. The first section will include communicating\nand working with data in a modern era. This includes data wrangling,\ndata visualization, data ethics, and collaborative research (via\nGitHub). The second part of the course will focus on traditional\nstatistical inference done through computational methods (e.g.,\npermutation tests and bootstrapping). The last part of the course will\nfocus on machine learning ideas such as classification, clustering, and\ndimension reduction techniques. Some of the methods were invented before\nthe ubiquitous use of personal computers, but only because the calculus\nused to solve the problem was relatively straightforward (or because the\nmethod wasn’t actually every used). Some of the methods have been\ndeveloped quite recently.\nAnonymous Feedback As someone who is constantly\nlearning and growing in many ways, I welcome your feedback about the\ncourse, the classroom dynamics, or anything else you’d like me to know.\nThere is a link to an anonymous feedback form on the landing page of our\nSakai webpage. Please provide me with feedback at any time!\nCourse Goals:\nto be able to work through the entire computational statistics flow\nchart as a data analyst.\nto be able to use graphical representations of data to communicate\nideas about the data.\nto be able to identify, understand, and describe the uses and\nmisuses of algorithms and data collection from an ethical lens with the\npurpose of preventing harms from data science.\nto critically evaluate analyses / graphics of data (typically big\ndata or dynamic data).\nto communicate results effectively.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nStatement\n(adapted from Monica Linden, Brown University):\nIn an ideal world, science would be objective. However, much of\nscience is subjective and is historically built on a small subset of\nprivileged voices. In this class, we will make an effort to recognize\nhow science (and statistics!) has played a role in both understanding\ndiversity as well as in promoting systems of power and privilege. I\nacknowledge that it is possible that there may be both overt and covert\nbiases in the material due to the lens with which it was written, even\nthough the material is primarily of a scientific nature. Integrating a\ndiverse set of experiences is important for a more comprehensive\nunderstanding of science. I would like to discuss issues of diversity in\nstatistics as part of the course from time to time.\nPlease contact me if you have any suggestions to improve the quality\nof the course materials.\nFurthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my\nstudents that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and\nexperiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class,\nsexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To help accomplish this:\nIf you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those\nthat appear in your official records, please let me know!\nIf you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by\nyour experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and\ntalk with me. You can also relay information to me via your mentors. I\nwant to be a resource for you. If you prefer to speak with someone\noutside of the course, the math liaisons, Dean of Students, or QSC staff\nare all excellent resources. I (like many people) am still in the\nprocess of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If\nsomething was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel\nuncomfortable, please talk to me about it. As a participant in course\ndiscussions, you should also strive to honor the diversity of your\nclassmates.\nTexts:\nAll resources are freely available.

Your task is to use data\nto tell us something interesting. This project is deliberately\nopen-ended to allow you to fully explore your creativity. There are\nthree main rules that must be followed: (1) data centered, (2) tell us\nsomething, (3) do something new. The project information is available\nhere: Math 154 Semester Project\nComputing:\nGitHub will be used as a way to practice reproducible and\ncollaborative science. There may be a slight learning curve, but knowing\nGit will be an extremely useful skill as you venture on after this\nclass.\nR will be used for all homework assignments. R is freely\navailable at\nhttp://www.r-project.org/\nand is already installed on college computers. Additionally, you need to\ninstall R Studio in order to use R Markdown,\nhttp://rstudio.org/.\nIf you are not already familiar with R, please work through some of the\nmaterials provided ASAP.\nYou are welcome to use Pomona’s R Studio server at\nhttps://rstudio.campus.pomona.edu/\n(or\nhttps://rstudio.pomona.edu\nif you are off campus). If you use the server, you can connect directly\nto your Git account without installing Git locally on your own computer.\n[If you are not a Pomona student, you will need to get an account from\nPomona’s ITS. Go to ITS, tell them that you are taking a Pomona course,\nand ask for an account for using RStudio.]\nParticipation:\nThis class will be interactive, and your participation is\nexpected (every day in class). Although notes will be posted, your\nparticipation is an integral part of the in-class learning\nprocess.\nIn class: after answering one question, wait until 5 other people\nhave spoken before answering another question. [Feel free to ask as many\nquestions as often as you like!]\nAcademic Honesty:\nYou are on your honor to present only your work as part of your\ncourse assessments. Below, I’ve provided Pomona’s academic honesty\npolicy. But before the policy, I’ve given some thoughts on cheating\nwhich I have taken from Nick Ball’s CHEM 147 Collective (thank you, Prof\nBall!). Prof Ball gives us all something to think about when we are\nlearning in a classroom as well as on our journey to become scientists\nand professionals:\nThere are many known reasons why we may feel the need to “cheat” on\nproblem sets or exams:\n\nAn academic environment that values grades above learning.\nFinancial aid is critical for remaining in school that places undue\npressure on maintaining a high GPA.\nNavigating school, work, and/or family obligations that have\ndiverted focus from class.\nChallenges balancing coursework and mental health.\nBalancing academic, family, peer, or personal issues.\n\nBeing accused of cheating – whether it has occurred or not – can be\ndevastating for students. The college requires me to respond to\npotential academic dishonesty with a process that is very long and\ndamaging. As your instructor, I care about you and want to offer\nalternatives to prevent us from having to go through this process. If\nyou find yourself in a situation where “cheating” seems like the only\noption:\nPlease come talk to me. We will figure this out\ntogether.\nPomona College is an academic community, all of whose members are\nexpected to abide by ethical standards both in their conduct and in\ntheir exercise of responsibilities toward other members of the\ncommunity. The college expects students to understand and adhere to\nbasic standards of honesty and academic integrity. These standards\ninclude, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nIn projects and assignments prepared independently, students never\nrepresent the ideas or the language of others as their own.\nStudents do not destroy or alter either the work of other students\nor the educational resources and materials of the College.\nStudents neither give nor receive assistance in examinations.\nStudents do not take unfair advantage of fellow students by\nrepresenting work completed for one course as original work for another\nor by deliberately disregarding course rules and regulations.\nIn laboratory or research projects involving the collection of data,\nstudents accurately report data observed and do not alter these data for\nany reason.\n\nCovid Safety Awareness.\nThe faculty at Pomona College knows that person-to-person interaction\nprovides the best liberal arts education. The best learning occurs in\nsmall communities. This year we are gathering in person for what we do\nbest: create, generate, and share knowledge. During the past academic\nyear, we built community remotely, and this year we will build on the\npedagogical improvements we acquired last year. For example, we might\nmeet on zoom from time to time, or hold discussions online on Sakai\nDiscussions Board.\nOur health, both mental and physical, is paramount. We must consider\nthe health of others inside and outside the classroom. All Claremont\nColleges students have signed agreements regulating on-campus behavior\nduring the pandemic; in the classroom, we will uphold these agreements.\nWe need to take care of each other for this course to be successful. I\nask you therefore to adhere to the following principles:\nThere is a mask mandate for all indoor spaces on campus. You must\nwear a mask for the entire class; eating and drinking are not permitted.\nYour mask must cover your mouth and nose. The college has zero-tolerance\nfor violations of this policy, and our shared commitment to the health\nand safety of our community members means if you come to class unmasked\nyou will have to leave class for the day.\nClass attendance is required, but if you need to miss class for\nhealth reasons, concerning symptoms, suspected Covid exposure,\nunexpected dependent care, technology issues, or other emergency reasons\nI will work with you. Let me underscore this: please make your decisions\nalways based on health, safety, and wellness—yours and others—and I will\nwork with you at the other end. Take any potential symptoms seriously;\nwe’re counting on each other.\nWhen not in class, avoid closed public spaces, and if you can’t\navoid them: wear your mask properly, wash your hands, and maintain\nsocial distance.\nIf you, or a family member, are experiencing hardship because of\nthe pandemic, talk to me or to someone in the Dean of Students office.\nYou are not alone during this time.\nThe pandemic is fast-moving, and we might have to adjust the\nprinciples as the semester evolves. I am always happy to receive your\nfeedback to make this course work.\nLet’s care for each other, show empathy, and be supportive. While\nthere will likely be some community transmission and breakthrough\ninfections, together, we can minimize their effect on our community and\non your learning.\nAdvice:\nPlease email and / or set up a time to talk if you have any questions\nabout or difficulty with the material, the computing, or the course.\nTalk to me as soon as possible if you find yourself struggling. The\nmaterial will build on itself, so it will be much easier to catch up if\nthe concepts get clarified earlier rather than later. This\nsemester is going to be fun. Let’s do it.\nGrading:\n\n25% Homework\n45% Midterms\n25% Group Project & Presentation\n5% Class Participation\n\n\n\n\n",

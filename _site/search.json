Here is the basic structure of how it will work:\nGet the assignment materials from GitHub classroom.\nClone the repository to any machine you are using.\nWork on the assignment and push back to GitHub.\nSubmit the assignment on Gradescope.\nThe following diagram lays out the process, and the rest of the document provides a more detailed set of instructions.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Flowchart of assignment process.\n\n\n\nInstalling R + RStudio + Git\nMost importantly, please become familiar with Happy Git and GitHub with R. Happy Git with R is an incredibly user friendly resource which includes help for almost every single thing that might happen when getting started.\nHappy Git with R is your new best friend.\nThe first step is to install R + RStudio + Git on your machine. (If you are planning to use Pomona’s RStudio server, R + RStudio + Git are all three already installed for you.)\nCreate an account on GitHub (if you already have one, use it!).\nIntroduce everyone: R + RStudio (should happen automatically); yourself to GitHub (see https://happygitwithr.com/); RStudio + GitHub (see https://happygitwithr.com/).\nFollow the rest of the steps that Jenny Bryan spells out in Happy Git and GitHub with R.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The more you read Happy Git with R, the better your life will be.\n\n\n\nGet the assignment materials from GitHub Classroom\nEach assignment will provide a link to GitHub classroom. Click the link.\n\nWhen you use GitHub classroom for the first time, you’ll be asked to authorize GitHub classroom to access your repositories.\nThe first assignment will be an individual assignment. Some other assignments will be paired assignments. To accept an individual assignment, click the “Accept this assignment” button.\nFor all joint assignments, you will need to create a team before you can start.\nIf you are working with a partner, create a team name that contains both of your GitHub ids. (If you are working by yourself, use your GitHub id as your team name.)\n\n⚠ You may need to add a description of the assignment (for example “Lab 2”) to team name. This is because GitHub Classroom does seem to make it easy for some people to work in the same group as a previous assignment while other people form new groups.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: One partner accepts the assignment and creates the team.\n\n\n\nThe assignment files will be copied as a private repository that you (and your partner) and the course staff have access to.\nWe will call this version, that lives on your GitHub account the GitHub fork.\nIf you are working with a partner, the person who did not create the team and accept the assignment should now click the GitHub classroom link, find the newly created team, and click the Join button.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: The other partner joins the team.\n\n\n\nClone the assignment (or project) repository on to your own computer(s)\nOnce your repository has been created, you should clone the code to whatever computer you are working on. Just like a Google Doc, you can work on the files from different machines at different times. Unlike a Google Doc, you’ll have to make sure to open the repo (clone or pull if you’ve aleady cloned) and save the repo (commit + push) more deliberately.\nHappy Git with R is your new best friend.\nClick on the link for the repository.\npicture here\nClick the Clone or download button and copy the URL.\npicture here\nOn the cloning machine (e.g., your own compute or the RStudio server), create a new R project with\npicture here\nWork on the assignment, push back to GitHub\n\n⚠ Always start your work session with a pull to the computer you are working on, and end your session with a push back to GitHub.\nAll of the GitHub interaction will take place through the RStudio IDE. The two important steps for getting the assignment back to GitHub are:\npull\nIf you are working with a colleague or on different machines it is so incredibly important to get in the habit of immediately clicking on pull when you start your work. (If you are working alone on a single machine pull won’t hurt! You’ll just be told that your files are already up to date.)\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Always pull before you start.\n\n\n\ncommit your work\nWh\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Always pull before you start.\n\n\n\npush your work to GitHub\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Always pull before you start.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nHere’s your roadmap for the semester!\nEvery class session has four important sections. You should read about the details for each using the main menu at the top of this webpage.\nContent (): This page contains the readings, slides, and recorded lectures for the topic. Read and watch these first each day.\nLesson (): This page contains an interactive lesson that teaches you the principles and code you need to know. Go through these after doing the content.\nExample (): This page contains fully annotated R code that you can use as a reference for creating your own visualizations. This is only a reference page—you don’t have to necessarily do anything here. Each section also contains videos of me live coding the examples so you can see what it looks like to work with R in real time. This page will be very helpful as you work on your assignments.\nAssignment (): This page contains the instructions for either the session exercise (1–3 brief tasks), or for the two mini projects and final project. Assignments are due by 11:59 PM on the day they’re listed.\n\ntl;dr: You should follow this general process each day:\nDo everything on the content () page\nWork through the lesson () page\nComplete the assignment () while referencing the example ()\n\n\n\n\nTasks\nComplete the readings\nComplete the assignments\nEspecially work on the project proposal\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndate\n\n\ntopic\n\n\nnotes\n\n\nslides\n\n\nexample\n\n\ncode\n\n\ncontent\n\n\n8.31.21\n\n\nStarting with R + RStudio + Git\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.7.21\n\n\nData Viz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
